<p>
<strong>Effective June 1, 2015</strong>
</p>

<p>
Please read these terms of use carefully (“Terms”). These Terms govern and apply to your access and use of  www.Snippit.Space and Snippit’s alarm sharing services available via Snippit’s site mobile apps (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions described in these Terms. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, do not use our Service.
</p>


<strong>USE OF THE SERVICE</strong>


<p>
Snippit (“App”) allows you to share photo albums. As long as you comply with these Terms, you have the right to access and use the Service, for your own personal use. You may not: (i) copy, modify or distribute the App for any purpose; (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the App or the Service to any third party; (iii) decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App or the Service; (iv) make the functionality of the App or the Service available to multiple users through any means; or (v) use the Service in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with these Terms.
</p>

<p>
The following terms apply to any App accessed through or downloaded from any app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store or Google Play) where the App is made available (each an “App Provider”). You acknowledge and agree that:
</p>

<p>
These Terms are established between you and Snippit, and not with the App Provider, and Snippit (not the App Provider), is solely responsible for the App.
</p>
<p>
The App Provider has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
</p>
<p>
The App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
</p>
<p>
In the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Snippit will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms.
</p>
<p>
The App Provider, and its subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of these Terms as related to your license of the App, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, the App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the App against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
</p>
<p>
You must also comply with all applicable third party terms of service when using the App.
</p>

<p>
Our Service may change from time to time and/or we may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or features within the Service), possibly without prior notice to you. Our Service may, at some point, include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the Service, queries made through the Service, or from other information. The types and extent of advertising on the Service are also subject to change over time. In consideration for providing you the Service, you agree that we and our third party providers and partners may place advertising on our Service or in connection with the display of content or information on our Service. Certain features of our Service may be subject to additional terms or conditions, which will be posted with those features.
